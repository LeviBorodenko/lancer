# Lancer
Ever heard of [Black](https://github.com/psf/black)? This is the opposite.
A tool to turn your clean python code into a hideous (working) mess.

## Features
1. Turn all comments into Pitbull lyrics 💃 (or optionally, something safe for work)
2. Turn all your variable names into a mixture of animal sounds and horribly similar looking characters like "bark_bark_0OO0O". 🐶
3. Add irritating white spaces.
4. Add new, totally redundant comments.
5. Code still runs after all these _improvements_! 👷


## Example
Before:
```python


# Function that finds the sum of a list of numbers
def get_sum(nums: List[int]) -> int:

    sum = 0

    # Find the sum
    for num in nums:
        sum += num

    # Return the sum
    return sum

if __name__ == '__main__':
    sum = get_sum([1, 3])
    print(f"Sum of 1 and 3 is {sum}")

```

After:
```python


# Hey baby, givin' it your all when you're dancin' on me
def oink_oink_oink_IlΙlll (ribbit_ααaαα :List [int ])->int :

    # Setting value of sum
    sum =0

    # Forget about your boyfriend And meet me at the hotel room
    for num in ribbit_ααaαα :
        sum +=num

        # Forget about your boyfriend And meet me at the hotel room
    return sum

if __name__ =='__main__':
    # Setting value of sum
    sum =oink_oink_oink_IlΙlll ([1 ,3 ])
    print (f"Sum of 1 and 3 is {sum}")

```

## Installation and Usage
Simply run `pip install py-lancer` and then use the `lance` command line tool.

```
usage: lance [-h] [--version] -f ./FILE_PATH.py [-s][-y]

Ever heard of Black? This is the opposite.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -f ./FILE_PATH.py, --file ./FILE_PATH.py
                        Python file to be lance'd.
  -s, --sfw             Generate comments that are safe for work.
  -y, --yolo            Overwrite original file, lol.
```

So if you have a python file at `./test.py`, you simply run `lance -f ./test.py`

## How does it work
The key tool we use it the `tokenizer` standard module in python. It allows us to tokenize any python script which then in turn makes substituting comments and variable names fairly simple.

## Contribute
Bug reports, fixes and additional features are always welcome! Make sure to run the tests with `python setup.py test` and write your own for new features. Thanks.
